# Making Colicin E1 for tolC negative selections
## This protocol will allow you to produce several hundred aliquots of Colicin E1 for selections. 
## Requirements:
* E. coli strain JC411
* Mitomycin C
* 6 4L Flasks each containing 1L LB
* 100% (w/v) Ammonium Sulfate Solution ~100mL
* Phosphate-Sodium Buffer (0.1M Potassium Phosphate, 1M Sodium Chloride, pH 7.0) ~1L
  * 9.3g K2HPO4
  * 6.3g KH2PO4
  * 58.4g NaCl
  * In 1L DI water
  * pH to 7.0
* Phosphate Buffer (0.1M Potassium Phosphate, ph 7.0) ~4L
  * 9.3g K2HPO4
  * 6.3g KH2PO4
  * In 1L DI water
  * pH to 7.0 
* Glycerol
* Dialysis tubing

## Procedure:
1. Grow up strain JC411 overnight in 3mL LB at 37C (this strain doesn't seem to form colonies on solid media so go direct to liquid)
1. Innoculate 500uL into each of the 6 flasks containing 1L LB. Grow until OD 0.4-0.6.
1. In each flask, induce Colicin production by adding 200uL 0.5mg/mL Mitomycin C. Continue growth at 37C overnight.
1. Spin down the cultures (30 minutes at 4000rpm). Pool all the supernatants into a fresh flask and store in 4C.

### Extracting Colicin from the Cell Pellet (This procedule is likely optional)
1. Resuspend the cell pellets in 80mL Phosphate-Sodium Buffer. Transfer the suspension into 2 **pre-weighed** 50mL conical tubes. 
1. Spin down the conical tubes. Discard the supernatant. Weight the tubes to determine the weight of the pellet.
1. Resuspend the pellet in 1mL/gram Phosphate-Sodium buffer.
1. Lyse the pellet:
   1. Prepare homogenizer by running 70% EtOH through to clean.
   1. Then run at least 500mL of ice-cold milliQ water through to clean and cool.
   1. Finally run 100mL Phosphate-Sodium buffer to equilibrate
   1. Now actually run the cell slurry: pour into sample funnel at top of instrument, start the flow through homogenizer at no pressure, then once primed increase pressure so that homogenization pressure (big gauge) peaks during compression cycle at ~15-20kPa. Flow rate is about 1mL per pump cycle.
   1. Run full volume through the instrument, collect at bottom in ice-cold vessel, then repeat by cyling the lysate through the homogenizer again.
   1. Clean out instrument with water, ethanol, water rinses.
1. Spin down lysate 15mins at 11,500 rpm at 4C (corresponding to 16300g).
1. Decant the supernatant into a fresh centrifuge tube (the supernatant contains the colicin)
1. Precipitate the colicin with ammonium sulfate. Colicin precipitates between 40-60% ammonium sulfate.
   1. Measure the volume of your lysate. Add enough 100% ammonium sulfate to the lysate to reach a final 40% ammonium sulfate.
   1. Spin for 10mins at 16000g.
   1. The supernatant contains the colicin, so decant the supernatant into a fresh centrifuge tube. 
   1. Add additional ammonium sulfate to reach a final 60% ammonium sulfate
   1. Spin for 10mins at 16000g.
   1. The pellet contains the colicin, so discard the supernatant, and resuspend pellet in 6mL Phosphate Buffer (no sodium this time).
1. Transfer the suspension into dialysis tubing. Dialyze in 4L Potassium Buffer overnight in the cold room. 
   1. Previously, we used precast dialysis cassettes made by Pierce scientific. They come with syringe injection ports for ease of use and have a 10mL capacity. We may need to use two just to ensure a good surface area-volume ratio. These membranes have a 3.5 kDa cutoff – compare this to ~56 kDa mass of colicin and 132 Da for the precipitation salt (ammonium sulfate).
1. Aliquot
   1. Prechill a couple hundred (~200) eppendorf tubes in -20C
   1. Add an equal volume of cold 100% glycerol to the dialyzed suspension.
   1. Aliquot 100uL into each eppendorf tube 
   1. Store in -80C.
### Extracting colicin from the supernatant. 
1. Lyophilize the supernatant
1. Resuspend the lyophylized supernatant in 1ml/g Phosphate Buffer.
1. Transfer the suspension into dialysis tubing. Dialyze in 4L Potassium Buffer overnight in the cold room.

#### Extraction Method:
Colicin is a secreted protein, so extracting from the supernatant is much simpler vs the cell pellet. Though it is uncertain which is more potent.
#### Titering for use
This is a crude extraction, so each aliquot batch must be titred for efficacy. Generally, test 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, 1:1000 dilutions of the Colicin stock against wild type E. coli to determine potency.
