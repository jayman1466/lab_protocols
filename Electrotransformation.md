* This protocol is to make electrocomp E. coli for plasmid transformations
** This protocol is scaled for small batch production. If you want to scale up the process to create electrocomp cells that you can freeze in the -80C for future use, replace water for 10% glycerol

1. Grow up E. coli in LB until OD 0.6. For each transformation, use 1-5mL of cell culture. 
1. Spin down the culture (1 min at 10000rpm in the small centrifuge) and place on ice. 
1. For each trasnformation, resuspend pellet in 1mL ice-cold water and transfer to eppendorf tube.
1. Spin down and resuspend in water.
1. Repeat for a second wash.
1. Spin down and resuspend in 50uL cold water. Add plasmid DNA (1-10ng is usually enough).
1. Transfer to a pre-chilled 1mm electrocuvette
1. Electroporate at 1800V.
1. Recover in 1mL LB or SOC for 30mins-1hour
1. Plate on selective media. You may need to do serial dilutions to get single colonies.
